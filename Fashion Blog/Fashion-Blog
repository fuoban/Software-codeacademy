    <p> NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly
      overwhelming, especially if you've never been.
      Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide
      and make your first show a pleasurable experience.
      By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut,
      you'll have an unforgettable experience!</p>

    <h2> Tickets and Shows</h2>

    <p> If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite,
      sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected
      my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First,
       plan out which shows are most important to you and
       make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET.
       If you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole
       time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days,
       and times and prioritize the designers you want to see
       most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited! </p>



    <h2> Dressing for the Shows</h2>

    <p> Always be true to your own sense of style,
      if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time
      and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing
      yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen
      to express through their new lines. Also it's important
       to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day.
       Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your
       feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
